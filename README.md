### Requirements

- **Panda3D SDK** (1.9.0 or newer)

### Installation

Run `python update_module_builder.py`. This will create a build file in the current directory, which you can then run with `python build.py`.
Now there should be a `LUI.pyd` or `LUI.so` depending on your system, which you can use in your project.

### Running the Samples

You can find various samples for the different LUI components in the `Demos` folder.

### Documentation

There is no official documentation yet, however if you look at the `Demos` folder, there should be a lot of self-explanatory code.
